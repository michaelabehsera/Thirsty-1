    <h1>HOW IT WORKS?</h1>
    <p>Our software makes the entire marketing process transparent</p>
    <p>You begin by creating an account and selecting your marketing cocktail based on your budget and your goals. Once you have done this, the wheels are put in motion.</p>
    <p>Your newly created campaign allows you to connect with writers who compete for your marketing dollars. Each writer submits an article. For every three articles submitted, only one will win the payout based on traffic so writers not only provide you with quality content, but they also help push your articles on their social channels to have a better shot at winning the payout.</p>
    <p>But thatâ€™s not all. You are also given access to real-time reporting, marketing support and our blog app store where you can add new themes and cool plugins with the click of your mouse. And depending on which package you choose, you could also receive a guaranteed number of unique visitors every month.</p>

    <h1>ARE YOU A WRITER?</h1>
    <p>Are you tired of low paying content writing gigs? Do you find companies who want to farm you out for 5 dollars for 500 words to be insulting?</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Then Thirsty is for you.</p>
    <p>Choose the topics you want to write about and submit your content directly to blog and web site owners. But make sure that it rocks, because you are competing with two other writers for that paycheck. If your content receives the most traffic, you win.</p>
